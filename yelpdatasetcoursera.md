# Yelp-Dataset---Role-Play-as-Data-Scientist
This is my data analysis project as part of the course I took on Coursera called "SQL for Data Science" by UC Davis

I used a dataset from a US-based organization called Yelp, which provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with a variety of organizations â€“ businesses, restaurants, health clubs, hospitals, local governmental offices, charitable organizations, etc. Yelp has made a portion of this data available for personal, educational, and academic purposes.

I was asked a series of questions regarding the data to help me profile and better understand the data in the first part of the assignment. Once I answered each question, I had to come up with my own question for analysis and to prepare a dataset for the analysis I chose to do in the second part of the assignment.
